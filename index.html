          <p>The company that I think does a good job of building community online is a footwear company, <a href="https://www.allbirds.ca/">Allbirds</a> .  Allbirds was founded in 2015, and their products are famous for its comfortable, simple design, and sustainable shoe material.  Their target audience is a minimalist who wants to buy high quality products that are simple and long lasting. Minimalism lifestyle is more accepted by millennials than other generation, and many of them use social media.  Therefore, their advertisement and building community by using social media, such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram are efficient.  They often post the photos of sheep that are part of the shoe material show their sustainable business styles that reduce carbon-footprint to coexist with animals.  This is helpful to increase the audience’s interest to purchase the product and interest to environmental problem.  Also, Allbirds says that they check comment on social media to reflect consumer’s needs.  In short, Airbirds will increase sales by using the online community well, will meet their customers' needs and improve eco-friendly business style</p>
